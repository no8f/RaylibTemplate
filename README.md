# A repository used as a starting point to work with raylib

> [!NOTE]
> Mainly for personal use, I don't stop anyone from using it, but I don't guarantee that it will work.

> [!NOTE]
> I will only do this for windows as my uni forces windows

## Prerequisites
- CMake installed
- MSVC installed
- When using cpack
    - Innosetup installed

## Usage
1. Use this template with the corresponding github button
2. When configuring, CPM will clone raylib so this may take a while
3. when using a code editor with clangd, compile once so the compile_commands.json is availible or clangd can't find the raylib header, then restart clangd
